      <p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">While in her primary levels, Divine engaged in a contest for beauty and brains, which she won and became Miss Risonpalm; this was the first and only pageant during her school days at the school. It was not until her third year in the University that the ambition came back and she decided to go fully into modelling. On November, 2020, she started off by getting a coach; she was a pageant model that was only able to train Divine for pageantries which basically focused on the grace in catwalks and speaking. She then went ahead to attend every casting call she could come accross and apply to every international agency she could find but was always rejected for her height as it did not match the standard height requirement for Runway modelling. Only a few minor fashion shows overlooked her height and focused on her petite size. She then took a short break to know her strenghts and weaknesses in modelling. Engaging in different photo shoots, she realised that she was very good at poses for different concepts and photogenic. She decided to drop her coach and build her portfolio with her strenghts. As a freelancer, she has particiapated in several photoshoots in collaboration with different Photographers. This helped her keep track of her social media life and she further ventured into content creation on Tiktok. You can say that she has a vast social media life on every social media platform.</p>
      <p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Furthermore, she has taken a keen interest in the Entertainment industry and has decided to be an actress. Using social media as her footstool, she has created several acting scenes and posted, some of which are on Tiktok and YouTube. Below are a few of her modelling shoots, most outfits and concepts were developed and inspired by her.</p>
