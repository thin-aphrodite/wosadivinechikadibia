    <!--Skill Sets Starts Here-->
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">While in her University days, she ventured into several skills, not just for the financial value of it but also for the knowledge. She always used her holiday periods to pick an interest in one skill or the other, she would always get all the items necessary to practice with and note books for record sake's. Below are the skills she acquired.</p>

<!--Column Starts Here-->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column" style="background-color: rgb(182, 211, 216); border-radius: 10%; border-style: ridge; border-color: rgb(81, 102, 4); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center;">
        <h3>Cobbling and Bag Making</h3>
        <p>This was actually acquired from her fellow female who also knew the craft, so she did not necessarily have to learn directly from an Hausa man. Having been sewing shoes with just threads and needles in secondary school, grasping this knowledge was not much of a challenge for her. She has all the tools necessary to make shoes, sandals, slippers, and bags. Most of her pictures on social media has proven that this skill is really proficient for her as she posts them online. Also understand that mending shoes has not even been an issue for her, she can as well do the job of an aboki man (an Hausa shoe mender).</p>

    <div class="column" style="background-color: rgb(182, 211, 216); border-radius: 10%; border-style: ridge; border-color: rgb(81, 102, 4); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center;">
        <h3>Tailoring</h3>
        <p>During her first year holiday, she had an interest in making clothes. Since her next level's curriculum had not yet had a lot of difficult courses, it was still a good time to venture into yet another skill; to sharpen her knowledge of course. As fashion was one of Divine's fascinations, she always had the inspiration to make different outfits and designs for herself and her family members. Sometimes, she literally made outfits from anything she could find and use. This even helped her more in her modelling photo shoots and creative concepts. Since then, all outfits and designs were made by her and posted online.</p>

    <div class="column" style="background-color: rgb(182, 211, 216); border-radius: 10%; border-style: ridge; border-color: rgb(81, 102, 4); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center;">
        <h3>Carpentry</h3>
        <p>This was actually acquired during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. During this period, staying home when it was not a holiday seemed bizzare to her and she thought of taking up another skill but a more challenging one. Carpentry was seen as a man's job and skill but that was something she also wanted to be good at despite her being a woman. It was actually a tough skill to acquire which required more time, energy, and tools to grasp. Having been taught by two carpenters, she had to take the longer period of learning and even went for outside jobs. She was also the only female amongst a lot of men at the workshop.</p>

        <div class="column" style="background-color: rgb(182, 211, 216); border-radius: 10%; border-style: ridge; border-color: rgb(81, 102, 4); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center;">
        <h3>On Air Perosnality</h3>
        <p>This was more of an internship than a skill acquired, as it was not paid for and neither did they pay her. A podcast actually advertised an opening for an OAP and she picked an interest. During the interview, they stated that they needed an experienced person but she volunteered to learn on the job and not get paid. Still in the spirit of entertaining others, she decided to put in her best for the radio entertainment skills and it was fun doing it. This was actually easy to learn while she was still in school because she only had the evening show to broadcast and it was for an hour; it was even close to her school and house.</p>

        <h3>Baking</h3>
        <p>Her mother knew how to bake and she picked up her interest from there. Growing up, Divine learnt to enjoy cake, especially the ice and sugar coatings. To her, a cake was the most balanced food in the world whilst containig all the six classes of food; which is actually true by the way, look it up. With constant practice and online tutorials, she was able to pass the beginners level. No birthday or celebration occurs in the house without a homemade cake that has to be devoured. She celebrated her birthday every year in the University, and every cake was more delicious and better decorated than the other.</p>

        <h3>Fish and Poultry Farming</h3>
        <p>Her family has a farm at their place of residence. Divine's mother actually started the trade while she was working before gaining admission into the University. She decided to also follow up with it despite already having knowledge of cakes. While in her third year, she advertised the poultry business to her course mates during the festive season and they all sold out before the New Year. It was a lucrative business that was enjoyable to learn and work at the same time. However, they had to stop selling it out in order to practice more at home and be better before going fully into it as a profitable business.</p>
